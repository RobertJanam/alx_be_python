# Program that finds the addition, subtraction and multiplication of two numbers
number1 = 10 # first number
number2 = 5 # second number

addition = number1 + number2

subtraction = number1 - number2

multiplication = number1 * number2

print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {addition}")
print(f"Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {subtraction}")
print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {multiplication}")
